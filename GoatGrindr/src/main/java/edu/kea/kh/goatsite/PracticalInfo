AUTO: Hibernate selects the generation strategy based on the used dialect,
- Auto - generation strategy selected, based on database dialect.

IDENTITY: Hibernate relies on an auto-incremented database column to generate the primary key,
- Identity - Generates a new value with each insert operation/action. - Drawback; Requires PK value for each changed entity.

SEQUENCE: Hibernate requests the primary key value from a database sequence,
- Sequence - uses database sequence to generate unique values - requires additional select statements to get the next
value of a database sequence. If no info is proved it 'Hibernate' will request the next value from its default sequence

TABLE: Hibernate uses a database table to simulate a sequence.
- table  It simulates a sequence by storing and updating its current value in a database table requiring
- pessimitic locks - putting all transactions in sequential order
